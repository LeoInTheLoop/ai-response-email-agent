# üì¨ Email Style Analyzer & Reply Generator

## üß† Overview  
This project analyzes a sender's email writing style and generates consistent, context-aware replies using GPT and the Enron Email Dataset. It integrates with [Semantic Kernel](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel) to orchestrate prompt flows and agent coordination.

## üöÄ Features & Modules

### ‚úÖ 1. Style Analysis Agent (Completed)

```mermaid

    A[Input Past Emails] --> B[Style Extractor]
    B --> C[Style Summary (JSON)]
```

* Parses historical emails from the sender.
* Outputs a JSON capturing writing traits such as:
  * Tone
  * Structure
  * Greeting and sign-off patterns
  * Language preferences

### ‚úâÔ∏è 2. Reply Generator (In Progress)

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[User Input + Incoming Email + Style Info] --> B[Reply Agent]
    B --> C[Generated Reply]
```

* Inputs:
  * Incoming email
  * Up to 5 recent email threads
  * Style summary (from Style Agent)
  * User instructions or intent
* Output: A reply email consistent with the sender‚Äôs writing style and context

---

### üß† 3. Mail Context Profiler (Planned)

* Purpose: Improve accuracy of style analysis by understanding deeper user context  
* Approach: Let GPT scan the user‚Äôs email history to build a richer, implicit tone model  
* Use Case: Enhances style consistency even for ambiguous or short prompts

### ‚è∏Ô∏è 4. Project Extractor (On Hold)

```mermaid

    A[Input Emails] --> B[Project Info Extractor]
    B --> C[Project Summary (JSON)]
```

* Extracts project-related details (temporarily deprioritized):
  * Project names, statuses, and timelines
  * Milestones
  * Involved members
  * Relevant keywords
